scout - ryrrg (SCOUT was not a forcing guess: the returned clues narrow down to only TACIT, but if the answer word was FAINT, PAINT, or TAINT, the guess of SCOUT would have returned rrrrg i.e. you would require another guess to guarantee the win)
tacit - ggggg

waltz - rgryr (49 answer words left after this clue, but no forcing guesses)
taker - ggrrr (only 8 answer words left after this clue: tabby, taboo, tacit, taffy, taint, tango, tangy, taunt. One forcing guess is BINGO: the B and O selects TABBY and TABOO, the I and N selects TACIT and TAINT, and the \_\_NGO selects from the remaining three: TAFFY, TANGO, TANGY)
