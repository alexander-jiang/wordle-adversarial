grail - rryry
aleph - yyrrr
lauds - yggrr
comby - grrrr
caulk - ggggg


sloth - grrry
share - gggrg
dumpy - rrrrr
shake - ggggg

raven - rrryr
eight - yryrr (maybe a second guess of "toils" would have been good, as it uses the top 5 most frequent ambiguous letters in the 199 remaining possible answer words: L (78), T (71), S (69), I (65), O (51).)
gulps - yrrrr (after 3rd guess, there were 2 possible answer words left: dodge and wedge)
dodge - ggggg


drape - rrrrr
built - rrggr (only 5 answer words left after this clue: chili, chill, icily, skill, swill: the ambiguous letters were c, h, s, k, w, y. You're looking for a guess word that ends with L (eliminates or confirms CHILI), and that includes S and (K or W) (eliminates or confirms SKILL / SWILL), and H (determines ICILY vs. CHILL), then that would be forcing. For example: SHAWL is forcing as each of the possible answer words maps to a different set of colors: rgrry -> CHILI, grrrg -> SKILL, grryg -> SWILL, rgrrg -> CHILL, rrrry -> ICILY)
jocks - rrrry (JOCKS was not a forcing guess: the returned clues narrow down to only SWILL, but if the answer word was CHILI or CHILL, the guess of JOCKS would have returned rrrrr i.e. you would require another guess to guarantee the win)
swill - ggggg


waltz - rgryr
miter - ryyrr (only 6 answer words remaining after this clue: faint, habit, paint, saint, tacit, taint: the ambiguous letters are n, b, c, f, h, p, s. An ideal guess would include N and (H, B, T in 1st position, or C) (eliminate or confirm HABIT / TACIT), and also use 3 of the following 4 letters: F, P, S, T (to choose among the words ending with _AINT). I'm not sure any of these exist (i should write a brute-force solver tries all guess words and looks for forcing guesses when there are fewer than X answer words remaining
scout - ryrrg (SCOUT was not a forcing guess: the returned clues narrow down to only TACIT, but if the answer word was FAINT, PAINT, or TAINT, the guess of SCOUT would have returned rrrrg i.e. you would require another guess to guarantee the win)
tacit - ggggg

waltz - rgryr
taker - ggrrr (only 8 answer words remaining after this clue: tabby, taboo, tacit, taffy, taint, tango, tangy, taunt)
tapas - ggrrr (there's a bug with the "remaining answer words": the gray clue for the A in the 4th position doesn't change the fact that there is an A at the 2nd position)
tangy - ggrrr
taboo - ggrrr
tacit - ggggg


heart - yyryy (only 5 answer words remaining after this clue: ether, other, their, three, threw)
ether - rgggg (there's a bug with the "remaining answer words": the gray clue for the E in the 1st position doesn't change the fact that there is an E somewhere other than in the 2nd position in the word. ETHER was not a forcing guess: the returned clues narrow down to only OTHER, but if the answer word was ????, the guess of ETHER would have returned ????? i.e. you would require another guess to guarantee the win)
other - ggggg


argue - ryrrr
storm - ryggr (after this clue, THORN is the only possible answer word remaining)
thorn - ggggg

argue - ryrrr
rhino - ygryy (after this clue, only 2 answer words remaining: SHORN, THORN)
shorn - rgggg
thorn - ggggg
